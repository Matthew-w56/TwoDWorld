ChunkManager System:


There are three lists for chunks in the world
-Left Chunk List   (Chunks that are off to the left of the visible screen)
-Middle Chunk List (Chunks actively being displayed, updated, and rendered)
-Right Chunk List  (Chunks that are off to the right of the visible screen)


-----[Creation and Set up]-----
To start, the ChunkManager.generate() method puts a small amount of chunks in the left list, building
first a starting chunk, then each chunk goes off from that one, each chunk being built off of
the previously built chunk.
Then, the ChunkManager.generate() method builds the middle list, going from left to right in the same way.
Lastly, it generates the right chunk list going left to right again, building off the previuosly
built chunk.

All of the creation is done by passing the chunk being created, the previously generated chunk, and the
positional relation between them (Which is on the left/right of which) to the WorldGenerator.create() method


-----[RunTime and Storing]-----
During runtime, only the chunks in the Middle List are actively being updated, moved, checked for
editing from player, and displayed.  The left and right chunk lists are simply stacks of currently
unused chunks to be used later when the player moved over to them.  As the leftmost chunk in the
Middle list enters the visible screen, it toggles a need to move another chunk from the left list
into the Middle list.  This is the same for the Rightmost chunk entering the screen.

When a chunk leaves the visible screen far enough due to the player moving around, it is moved to
the corresponding list, and removed from the Middle list and updating, until it is retrieved again.
