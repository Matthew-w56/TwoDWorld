So I attempted to solve the tutorial problem (not continuing the tutorial when the player breaks a block)
but realized that the entire method the call was in isn't getting called. So, where was it?  It took more
searching and tracking that I thought it would, so here's the lineup

1) Player clicks the mouse
2) Mouse.java receives the event
3) Mouse checks if the inventory is open
		if so, it finds the slot, and passes it on to the player
		with the associated slot
4) If not, it checks to see if the menu is open. If so, it deals
		with any button events.
5) If not, it checks to see if the creation window is open
		if so, it finds the slot, and passes it to the player
6) If not, it is assumed that the player just in the world, and
		it looks for any entities that are being touched and deals
		with them.
7) But then if none of those things apply, it just stops there. no
		passing to the player occurs.  This is because the things
		like block breaking and such are supposed to reccur while
		the button is pressed. So this method's job is just to set
		the environment state so that other threads can act accordingly.
8) At the start of the program, a thread is started in Threads.java called
		painter.  This loops, calling the world's paint method as well as
		a method the Player.java class has that checks the environment
		state in terms of if the mouse is clicked, and calls either the
		hit() or activate() method of a block that the mouse is touching
		if the constraints like distance and collision tests check out.
9) The block then deals with it's own durability, and takes a Tool from the
		player to take into account.



Wow, what a journey to fix a small flag ticking error.  But it was good because
I realized that I had multiple methods that were A) not being called and B) not
even finished in the first place.  At some point, I had written methods to do all
the same stuff in a slightly less thought through way, and those were the methods
that called the state change for the tutorial flag.  Whew.



Also, I deleted it, but enjoy is piece of comedy gold that was a comment in the
vistigal method.  Today, on April 5th, 2022, I do not remember either commitment
to this comment line:
} else if (selectedItem.getTypeId() == O.toolItem) {
			ItemTool tool = (ItemTool)selectedItem;																			   *********
			//Meant for breaking, but what? (Post mark: I have no idea what that comment meant)                                * Gold. *
			int distance = (int)Math.hypot(O.MX - midX, O.MY - midY);														   *********
			if (distance <= O.placeDistance && block != null && tool.getHarvestLevel() >= block.getHarvestLevel()) {
				System.out.println("[Player.leftClick] Tutorial Progress Block C");
			}
		}
