Entity System

----------[How It Works]----------
So there is a master-list in the O.world class called middleEntities that holds all the
Entities that are in the middle area, and as such as updated and moved around.  Once an
entity finds itself touching no chunks, which means it is not in the middle anymore, it
it is attached to the top chunk of the chunk stack at the side it went off at.  So, if
an entity ended up off the right side, it would be attatched to the leftMost chunk in the
chunkListRight list.

Each Chunk has a small list attatched to it to hold Entities, and a method that flushed the
entities out of it, adding them to the middle list agian.  This method is called when the 
chunk is added back to the middle list itself.


----------[Parts of an Entity]----------
Every Entity is split into two parts:
-an Entity Class (Which is like the brain)
-a Model Class (Which is like the body/puppet)

The Entity Class of it makes logical choices of what to do, where to go, and how to do things
The Model Class of it is the body of the entity, so it is the list of hit_boxes, and movement methods,
	and things like that for the entity
