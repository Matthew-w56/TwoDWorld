Inventory and Item Systems


-----[Set Up]-----
The Inventory System is as follows:
There are two sets of Inventory/Inventory slots
-Hotbar         (Always visible)
-Back Inventory (Visible upon activation with E)

Inventory Class holds [O.hotcount] slots in the hotbar, and [O.backRows] X [O.backCols] slots in the back inventory


-----[General]-----
If the Back Inventory is activated, the mouse can grab items out of the hotbar to hold and place elsewhere, and items can be placed in the hotbar
If the mouse still has an item with it when the full inventory is deactivated, the item is taken from the mouse and given to the player as if
  the item is collected in any other way


-----[Hotbar]-----
The Hotbar is always visible in the bottom of the screen, and is a bundle of a certain amount of InventorySlot class instances.
Each Slot holds an item (null or not), a count (the number of that item being held), and a rectangle for collision with the mouse (referred to as rect)
Each slot will display itself, and then any item it has in it, if it has any


-----[Back Inventory]-----
The Back Inventory is only visible when it is activated, which freezes the player's movement, and shows a grid of InventoryBackslots.
The Back Inventory is a 2d Array of InventoryBackslots, which each have a rect, item, and count much like the Hotbar slots.
The main difference between backslots and hotbar slots are their visibility times, and backslots are a bit smaller to be able to
  fit in the tight area, and they display the item correspondingly smaller to account for the size difference.
