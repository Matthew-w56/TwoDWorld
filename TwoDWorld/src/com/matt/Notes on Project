So this is a project that has had a lot of versions and a lot of ideas.  But, I'm going to move onto other projects because
this has a lot of mistakes in it's structure and execution that would require a full remake to undo, and I don't have much
motivation to do that right now.  But here are a few of the things to work on, when you feel like it:

1) World System
  So the entire world/movement system is messed up.  When the player moves, it actually moves the literal position of every
  chunk, and every block.  This is a huge waste of effort and time, so the new way would be to have the world exist completely
  outside of the display screen, and completely outside of the mouse position.  Then, there would be a class/structure to mediate
  with the player by deciding which area of this stationary world to display, and where to register the mouse clicks and such.
  This would require both a remake of the World and Chunk systems, but also the Screen, and display, as well as all the
  event listeners and coordination with them

2) Block/Item System
  With these, I have gone through many ideas of how to best organize, refer to, and use items and blocks. I've thought of having
  a master registry, referred to by the other classes.  I've thought of having a seperate instance of a class for each block.
  I've thought of having blockMaterial types, that each generic block acts by the rules set forth in it's type.  I've also
  debated whether a single item had to be it's own variable/instance, a reference to a static enum, or even just an ID with
  rules of behavior.  The last might be the most effective, though I haven't gone through and made something like that work yet.

3) Threads
  In each version of the project, it has had some random jumble of where certain systems are updated regularly (such as displaying
  the world or moving the player).  And I'm still not sure the best way to sort them out into threads, or if there needs to be
  multiple threads in the first place.

4) Menu screens
  There just HAS to be a better way to have menus and interactables than what I created in this project.  they were simply meant
  to be interactable and get you where you need to go.  But if you are revamping this project to take it any further, please
  find a better way to impliment menus into the game.
  
Have fun!
