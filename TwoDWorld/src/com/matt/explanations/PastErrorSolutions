Previous Errors and Their Solutions:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entities Teleporting when they turn around:

-Problem: When an entity would turn around, it would generally
 teleport up above the wall they were against.
 
-Solution: Fixing the hitBox area to be symmetrical

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entities Not interacting with the terrain correctly when player was moving, too:

-Problem: When the player was sitting still, the entities walked around
 the world just fine.  When the player started moving, they would
 seem to move with the world, but just a step behind.  They would
 end up colliding with blocks they weren't supposed to be able to
 collide with.
 
-Solution: I found that the call to update the hitBoxes of all the
 terrain blocks was only being called in the moveX method of
 ChunkManager, and not the moveY, so when the player jumped, the
 boxes were not being updated.  So, the entity appeared to be
 moving into the blocks.  I just placed the call, and it was fixed.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Everything running slow:
 
 -Problem: When I was checking for collisions, it was looping through every
  single block in the middle list (Which is about 14,400 blocks)
  for every single entity and player and mouse click seperately.
  When recorded, this added up to about 27,000 collision tests
  each game tick
 
 -Solution: I set it up to mathmatically find out the viable areas where it
  is worth it to check for collision for each thing, so that they
  only check for collision with the blocks around them.  This
  reduced the collisions each tick to about 190-250 (~100x faster).
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Chunk Seams Breaking:
 
 -Problem: Whenever a chunk with an entity stored inside it was loaded,
  it would be placed about 5-7 pixels off away from the other chunks.
  When the player moved towards the middle of it, it would move the
  opposite way, and introduce more chunks totaling about 50-70 and keep
  going until the inventory was activated, the menu was opened, or the
  user quit.
 
 -Solution: I'm not completely certain as to why it worked, but when I
  swapped "Move Block One" and "Move Block Two" in the ChunkManager
  ChunkToLeft and ChunkToRight methods, it stopped failing, and started
  working again.
  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Same Items Sharing Durability:
 
 -Problem: When an item (ex. Wood Axe) was used, the durability decrease
  would affect every Wood Axe, whether or not it was crafted yet at the
  time or not.  And as one would break, it would get discarded, leaving
  all the others with a negative durability, making them invincible.
  
 -Solution: When the item was being crafted, the player was being given
  a direct reference to the model WoodAxe item, so every axe the player
  had was simply the same item being in multiple places at once.  Once the
  items were switched to getNew() calls for each, the problem was solved,
  and items were seperate agian.
